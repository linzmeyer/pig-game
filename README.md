2 Player Dice Rolling App


GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

- There is a ROUND SCORE and a GLOBAL SCORE.
  - The ROUND SCORE is the accumulation of your points during your round. This is found below your player's name.
  - The GLOBAL SCORE is the accumulation of your points overall. This is found at the bottom in a red box labeled "current".
  
- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to the player's ROUND SCORE.

- If the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost and returns to 0. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND SCORE gets added to their GLOBAL SCORE. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game!
